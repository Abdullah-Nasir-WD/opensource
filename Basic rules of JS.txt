				"Basic javascript rules/guidence for bigginers"



1.Variables: Use let, const, or var to declare variables.

-let allows you to reassign a value.
-const is used for constants, values that can't be reassigned.
-var is older and less commonly used due to issues with scoping.




2.Data Types: JavaScript has 6 primitive data types:

-String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, and Symbol.
-Non-primitive types include Objects and Arrays.




3.Function Declaration: Functions are used to perform tasks or calculations.
for example:

"javascript
Copy
function greet(name) {
  return 'Hello ' + name;
}"




4.Semicolons: JavaScript doesn’t always require semicolons at the end of statements due to Automatic Semicolon Insertion, but it’s best practice to include them to avoid potential issues.




5.Equality: Use === (strict equality) and !== (strict inequality) to check both type and value. Avoid using == or !=, which can lead to unexpected type conversions.




6.Comments: Use // for single-line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.



7.Conditionals: Use if, else if, and else for branching logic.



8.Loops: JavaScript supports loops like for, while, and do...while for repeated execution of code.




9.Objects and Arrays: Objects store collections of data in key-value pairs, while arrays store ordered data.



10.Events: JavaScript is event-driven, and event listeners are used to respond to user actions like clicks or keypresses.
